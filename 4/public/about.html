<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I am Zeynep 
  I am a fourth-year Computer Engineering student based in Istanbul, with a strong interest in software development and artificial intelligence.
  I am currently improving my skills in backend web and mobile application development, while also working on AI and machine learning projects.
  I enjoy building projects, learning by doing, and approaching problems with an analytical mindset.
  In addition to technology, I’m interested in art and photography, which help me bring a more creative perspective to problem-solving.</p>
